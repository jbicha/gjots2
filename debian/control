Description: A simple jotter (outline processor) for X11/gtk-gnome
 gjots2 is a fairly simple jotter (outline processor) application for your
 desktop.
 .
 You can use gjots2 to organize your jottings into a tree structure, adding
 thoughts and miscellany as you go. You can get it to spit out HTML, XML,
 postscript, pdf, man etc etc if you want (see the online manual for an example
 of the HTML conversion).
 .
 I use it for all my notes on Unix, my personal bits and pieces, recipes and
 even PINs and passwords (encrypted with ccrypt(1), openssl(1) or gpg(1)).
 I also use it to write DOCBOOK XML documents.
 .
 You can use it to "mind-map" your compositions - write down all your thoughts
 and then start organizing them into a tree. By manipulating the tree you can
 easily reorder your thoughts and structure them appropriately.
 .
 It's a bit like the KDE program kjots but it uses the GTK-2 library.
