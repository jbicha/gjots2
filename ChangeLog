2005-06-19    Gabriel Munoz <munozga@gmail.com> Version 2.2.0
	
	* The menus and toolbars have been re-organized for consistency.
	
	* Added different icons for many of the tool buttons.

	* Added options for viewing icons/text/both on the toolbars.
	* A context menu has been added when right-clicking the tree.
	
	* Tree sorting and text sorting has been separated.
	
	* The cut, copy, and paste commands have been consolidated to do
	the right thing with tree items and text based on what has the
	user focus.
	
	* We are now using a clipboard that will make copying and pasting
	from other applications into gjots2 and within gjots2 easier (and
	as it should be expected).
	
	* Made it easier for people to run gjots2 from its source directory.
	
	* Fixed hiding the toolbars to remove them from the screen, rather
	than just removing the icons and leaving dead screen space.
	
	* Fixed the export dialog cancel button to actually cancel the
	operation.
	
	* Fixed to handle the window manager close event so that gjots2
	will always have a clean exit and no changes will be lost.
	
	* Lots of code cleanup, e.g. removal of dead code.
	
	* Added a "Gjots FAQ" section to the documentation.
	
	* Many bug fixes for stability were made.

		if body and not body[-1] == '\n'

	* (Bug sent in by Thomas Zajic): hard-coded references to "/usr"
	should be replaced with something more adjustable to allow

	systems without RPM or emerge.
